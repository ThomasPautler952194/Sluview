      "From the moment we walked in, the service was excellent! Sky at the front made us feel right at home with great food recommendations, and our server Lucy was amazing--attentive, kind, and on point with everything. We even left her a great tip because she truly earned it.<br><br>
      But the bar was a completely different story. I asked bartender Vick for water, and not only did he ignore me the first time, but when I asked again respectfully, he gave me attitude, served others first, and then left my water at the far end of the bar like I wasn't worth the effort. When I asked another bartender, Henry, for his name, he also responded with attitude.<br>
      The manager handled the situation professionally and apologized, but no customer spending good money should be treated like that. The restaurant itself is great, but the bartenders need serious improvement"</p>
