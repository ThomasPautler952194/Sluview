** Bavarian Soft Pretzel = (4.15) Very tasty & Shareable Liked the beer cheese & honey mustard too;)
** Jagerschnitzel = (4) very tasty
** Oktoberfest Platter = (4) very good
** Apple Dumpling = (4) very good & shareable",48,Luis B.,11-Sep-25,"From the moment we walked in, the service was excellent! Sky at the front made us feel right at home with great food recommendations, and our server Lucy was amazing--attentive, kind, and on point with everything. We even left her a great tip because she truly earned it.

But the bar was a completely different story. I asked bartender Vick for water, and not only did he ignore me the first time, but when I asked again respectfully, he gave me attitude, served others first, and then left my water at the far end of the bar like I wasn't worth the effort. When I asked another bartender, Henry, for his name, he also responded with attitude.

The manager handled the situation professionally and apologized, but no customer spending good money should be treated like that. The restaurant itself is great, but the bartenders need serious improvement",3,Bobby J.,5-Sep-25,"According to company policy, if you call the restaurant looking for a patron you're trying to relay an emergency to, they cannot relay the message. 

My nephew's aggressive I'm dog sitting got out and he wasn't answering his phone. I knew he was at the restaurant and they couldn't relay the message. 

Now he's looking at a possible lawsuit from the family of the kid that Cookie bit and will likely have to put him down. 

Absolutely ridiculous ""company policy"" 

RIP Cookie 2019-2025",1,Crystal O.,23-Aug-25,"KAREN is the best!!!! AARON is pretty alright too :)

ZUCCHINI CHIPS no complaints

ambiance;
Standard Clyde's. No complaints. Def better with KAREN!!",54,Johnnie C.,3-Aug-25,"Let me start with this was a ""wow"" experience...

The food, service and atmosphere were all terrific.  Alex our waiter was particularly great and I would request him.

We started with the raw bar and enjoyed jumbo shrimp and oysters.  Followed by salad.
Entrees were delicious (pictured) and perfectly cooked and seasoned.

Everything was beyond expectations and we enjoyed every minute.  I'm ready to go again!",Roberto B.,2-Sep-25,"Had a nice impromptu dinner on way back from Day of errands.   Such a nice Restaurant with peaceful relaxing feel. 

Had the Pork Chop (delicious w/o sauce) & Branzino (delicious w/ decent sauce) & Sides with Broccolini (ok sauce) & Mushrooms (delicious).   Sauces were a bit sub par but the rest was great. 
Service & the Server were wonderful
Can't wait to come back and experience the inside rooms.",Joy B.,4-Jun-25,"Well, it was time for a Girl's Night Out. We decided on Clyde's because it has something for everyone. Are you craving seafood? Clyde's has it. Are you craving beef? Clyde's has it. Do you have food allergies? Clyde's provides excellent care in preparing meals for people with food allergies. 

   We love the decor and usually ask to sit in the front dining room. They have all kinds of pictures and artifacts having to do with horses. There are real saddles, polo sticks, uniforms, and other decor that celebrate horses. We were fascinated with the ambiance. 

    For dinner, one guest got the crab cake platter. The crabcake was delicious. It was fresh, not any filler, and seasoned well. It was accompanied by crispy French fries and cool creamy coleslaw. 

   Another guest, got the Biria tacos. She loved them and said they were flavorful and tasty. The dipping sauce was great. I would recommend getting a side dish with this entry. 

  The third guest ordered the cheeseburger and fries. She was delighted with her meal. It was a generous portion and she even ended up taking some home. 

   Service was great and we were carefully attended to for drink refills or  whatever we needed. 

   For dessert, one guest got the raspberry sorbet and she really liked the taste. 

   But, two of us shared the bread pudding with ice cream and that was a show stopper. It was soft, sweet, and caramelized. It was Amazing. I highly recommend you order it. 

   All of this good food and good service isn't cheap, but exceptional and well worth it. I am sure the ladies and I will be back soon.",Jamie P.,16-Sep-25,Clyde's is one of the few places in the Gaithersburg/Rockville/North Bethesda area that's actually open late (1am Fri/Sat and midnight otherwise) and that serves actual food (i.e. not a dive bar or diner).  Also - oysters are half price after 10pm!  Can't believe it took me so long to realize this.  It is the PERFECT place to come after a play or movie and get a bite to eat in a comfortable setting.  The oysters we had were delicious.  Both bars were also full and looked like a good scene if that's your thing - we sat in the dining area with the canoe.,Richard O.,10-Aug-25,Wonderful first time experience! Came here to celebrate friend's birthday with a group and the staff was more than accommodating. The ambiance has the cabin charm that adds to the restaurant allure especially in the wintertime. The food and drinks were great and everyone left quite satisfied.,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lyqmNHV6uCHoLRB72f1Nug/ms.jpg,"https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/KOGY4A4z2HIffPKslMLDNg/60s.jpg
